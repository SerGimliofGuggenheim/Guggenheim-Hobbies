    <p>Avengers endgame is the 4th installment of the avengers movies<br />
         in the marvel cinematic universe, the movie is set 5 years after the <br />
    events of avengers infinity war, where we witnessed the battle against <br />
    Thanos and his victory at the end of the movie, which is very rare. 
   <p>We also saw the demise of many heroes to Thanos' snap including <br />
    our favourite friendly neighbourhood spiderman and others.
    Avengers endgame begins<br /> with Scott Lang (Ant-man) escaping the quantum realm and 
    meeting up with the<br /> surviving heroes as they all prepare to undo Thanos' 
     snap by travelling back in time<br /> to retrieve the stones from various points in time.</p>
